 <h1> My Profile </h1> 
 <p> My name is amr shoeib. I'm originally from egypt. I love learning new languages. I am a fluent speaker of arabic, english.
     and I want to learn a few more.
    It excites me that I shall be able to see movies without subtitles,
    read original texts and connect freely with people from these areas.    
    Besides, it is also amazing to see the sort of similarities that exist between languages.
my background was a graphic design. so that's why i have choosen this program.</p>
